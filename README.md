# Easy Wins - Anti Anxiety To Do List

## Purpose of the App

**Easy Wins** is not your usual productivity app. It's designed for people with executive function challenges, particularly those struggling with anxiety. The app provides a simple, manageable way to break down overwhelming tasks into smaller, winnable actions, helping users build momentum and reduce internal overwhelm.

- **Not a productivity app:** This is a tool for managing internal overwhelm, not just a typical to-do list.
- **Build momentum with small wins:** Focus on achieving small tasks, one at a time, to build momentum.
- **The mission:** *“A tool for managing internal overwhelm—by turning swirling thoughts into gentle, clear, winnable actions.”*

## Key Features

- **Task Breakdown:** Input a task that feels overwhelming. The app then breaks it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. You can only add a task when you feel it’s manageable enough to start.
- **One Task at a Time:** You can write down a number of tasks, but you can only actively work on one at a time.
- **Satisfying Completion Feedback:** When a task is completed, the app provides satisfying, dopamine-boosting feedback, turning completion into a rewarding experience.
- **Momentum Board:** A daily-use board to track your progress, with a visual representation of your completed tasks over time.

## Tech Stack

This app is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**
  - **React** for building a dynamic, interactive user interface.
  - **Vite** for fast and modern front-end tooling.
  - **CSS** (with custom styles) for a simple and clean design.

- **State Management:**
  - **React State** to manage app state, including tasks and completion tracking.

## App Structure

- **Task List:** View and manage all your tasks, see their breakdown, and mark subtasks as complete.
- **Momentum Board:** Visualizes your progress with a daily log of completed tasks and provides motivational feedback.

## Purpose Behind Easy Wins

Traditional to-do lists assume that you can easily start and finish tasks without much friction. However, for many people (especially those with anxiety or executive function challenges), this isn’t the case. **Easy Wins** helps users manage tasks in a way that is easier and less overwhelming.

- **Focus on simplicity:** The app simplifies tasks into bite-sized steps, and users only see the next actionable step, making the process less overwhelming.
- **Encouragement and momentum:** Through small, achievable wins and satisfying feedback, the app fosters positive reinforcement and helps build a sense of progress.
